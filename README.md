# TextMood

Ever wondered if that text message you just received is happy or angry? 

In this repo, we show how to leverage [Microsoft Cognitive Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cognitive-services/?WT.mc_id=none-github-bramin), [Azure Functions](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/functions/?WT.mc_id=none-github-bramin), and Twilio to automatically determine the sentiment of each text message.
